# Django_LogIn_Page
This django project is a login/signup interface that'll create and store user credentials as well as validate existing users during login. 

# Create a Virtual Environment 
Virtual Environment acts as dependencies to the Python-related projects. It works as a self-contained container or an isolated environment where all the Python-related packages and the required versions related to a specific project are installed. In the git, run:
    pythom -m venv. 
    This creates a virtual environment "venv"
    
    Activate the environment:
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    
Install Django in the env and you're good to go!
